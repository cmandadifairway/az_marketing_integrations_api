## Execution

1. Clone the repo onto your own system (or just download).

2.  Find and replace all instances of ff-admin-api with your own values. This is used to name the resources.

3. Update the config & workspace specific yaml files to your specifications

4. Run terraform init to configure the storage for your state file:

   ```hcl
   terraform init -backend-config="access_key=<value>"
   ```

5. Next create or select your workspace

   ```
   terraform workspace select dev || terraform workspace new dev
   ```

6. Next run terraform plan, you will be prompted to fill out any missing input variables:

   ```
   terraform plan -var client_secret="<value>"
   ```

7. If your plan is correct you can then apply the configuration

   ```
   terraform apply -var client_secret="<value>"
   ```
